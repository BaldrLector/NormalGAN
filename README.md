# NormalGAN
**NormalGAN: Learning Detailed 3D Human from a Single RGB-D Image (ECCV 2020)**<br>
Lizhen Wang, Xiaochen Zhao, [Tao Yu](https://ytrock.com/), [Yebin Liu](http://www.liuyebin.com/) and Songtao Wang<br>
We propose NormalGAN, a fast adversarial learning-based method to reconstruct the complete and detailed 3D human from a single RGB-D image.


# Code and pretrained models
We will release the code and pre-trained models soon.
